## Abstract
In this study, in order to classify the pictures of galaxies automatically, we have
built a model of convolutional neural networks (CNN). With the optimized VGG-16
structure and semi-supervised machine learning strategy, the model has shown
surprising accuracy and efficiency in the differentiation between galaxies. The
datasets of galaxy pictures are from EFIGI and Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2). First, three
major galaxy types: Ellipticals (E), Spirals (Sc) and Irregular (I) have been well
classified. With 2,468 galaxy images as training data, the model can reach 94%
classification accuracy. Then, we expanded classification to 8 types: E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sc,
SBa, SBb, and SBc. With the help of semi-supervised strategy which using
autoencoder as pretrained model, data for model training was successfully enlarged
from 1,923 to 3,181 pictures, and the averaged classification accuracy finally
increased from 12.87% to 54.12%. Despite the similarity among spiral galaxies, the
model still can differentiate E (80%), Sb (80%), SBb (85%) and Sc (85%) patterns. In
conclusion, machine learning with semi-supervised strategy has been shown a better
solution when well-recognized galaxy patterns are not enough for model training, and
we hope the method could paved a new way for automatic astronomy patterns
recognition.
## Data

## Usage
In our study, there are two tasks, the first task is about three type galaxy classification, the other is about eight type galaxy classification.<br/>
If you want to train a three type galaxy classifier, you can find out the source code in three_type folder.
```
python3 train_our_CNN.py // In this code, we construct the CNN on ourself.
python3 train_VGG16.py // In this code, we utilize VGG16 to be our CNN model.
```
